# spotmovie

Perl script(s): spotmovie.pl

Author: John McClymont

This script attempts to find a movie on a "Wanted" list within a
downloaded TV schedule.

This script is designed to be used on my Raspberry Pi 2 machine.

Debug level is set by a command line argument
  :Level 0 - no debug information
  :Level 1 - returns input
  :Level 2 - returns processing information

INPUT: temp.txt (HanDBase output containing Wanted list. This file is
       created by running HanDBase for Android. The file is made
       available to raspberrypi1 via MegaSync.)
       list.xmltv (Downloaded weekly TV schedule. This is generated by
       a cron job local to raspberrypi1 which uses the XMLTV system.)
OUTPUT: spotmovie.txt (This file is created in the script folder which is
        made available to other devices via MyCloud.)

Future development:
1) Currently only uses one TV schedule file. Might want to extend this.
2) Could email results rather than write to file
3) In first part of code where WANTED data is being partitioned, Could
   try to use the "push" function, rather than the false loop
4) Might want to extract the debug level handling into a function.
